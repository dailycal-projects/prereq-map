AST C210,X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation,3 Units," Physics 110, 137, and Mathematics 53, 54 or equivalent","Terms offered: Fall 2017, Fall 2016, Spring 2009<br/>
This course explores modern developments in the physics and applications of x-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. It begins with a review of electromagnetic radiation at short wavelengths including dipole radiation, scattering and refractive index, using a semi-classical atomic model. Subject matter includes the generation of x-rays with synchrotron radiation, high harmonic generation, x-ray free electron lasers, laser-plasma sources.",0
