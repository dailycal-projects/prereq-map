NSE C203,Nanoscale Fabrication,4 Units,,"Terms offered: Spring 2016, Spring 2015, Spring 2013<br/>
This course discusses various top-down and bottom-up approaches to synthesizing and processing nanostructured materials. The topics include fundamentals of self assembly, nano-imprint lithography, electron beam lithography, nanowire and nanotube synthesis, quantum dot synthesis (strain patterned and colloidal), postsynthesis modification (oxidation, doping, diffusion, surface interactions, and etching techniques). In addition, techniques",0
